# CarInsuranceApp
 
During this project, I created an MVC web application which featured a home page, a userpage, and an admin page.

In the user page, users could input their information, ranging from DUI status, Speeding Tickets, and other personal information. Based on this, the application would create a DB object of the user and in turn provide a quote for pricing based on business logic. The site administrators could then view all users and quotes issued on the Admin page.
